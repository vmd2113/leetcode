    /***
     * You are given an integer array digits, where each element is a digit. The array may contain duplicates.
     *
     * You need to find all the unique integers that follow the given requirements:
     *
     * The integer consists of the concatenation of three elements from digits in any arbitrary order.
     * The integer does not have leading zeros.
     * The integer is even.
     * For example, if the given digits were [1, 2, 3], integers 132 and 312 follow the requirements.
     *
     * Return a sorted array of the unique integers.
     *
     * Input: digits = [2,1,3,0]
     * Output: [102,120,130,132,210,230,302,310,312,320]
     * Explanation: All the possible integers that follow the requirements are in the output array.
     * Notice that there are no odd integers or integers with leading zeros.
